#Email Project in react for roc8 moonshot!

Things to improve project:
1. Restructure the EmailList component so that EmailBody and list of emails are in siblings in a parent div. This will also make it easier to make the app responsive.
1. Apply position :sticky to the email body so that it is always opened at the same position instead of at the top of the page.
1. On filtering for read , unread and favorites the emails remain in their respective page even if there is space in the earlier pages.
